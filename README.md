# Controlmycom-withChatGPT
Control your's com with voice to using ChatGPT

This project was carried out in python 3.12.2 (venv) virtual environment.

If the version does not match when installing openai, migration is required, but it can be solved by lowering the version of openai to 0.28

Python 3.12.x and later versions can be replaced by "pip install setuptools" instead of Python3-destutils disappearing

Required Installation
pip install openai\n
pip install SpeechRecognition\n
pip install subprocess\n
pip install os\n
pip install pyttsx3\n
pip install pyaudio\n
pip install setuptools
